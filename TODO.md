- Add measurements to grid (grid spacing is in mm, see gridSize and
	gridStep in setup.js)
- Add feature detection to get measurments (no?)
	- e.g. dollar bill
- User: rotate and translate image in plane
- Automatically scale image in plane
- Check to see if mouse moved in between mouseDown and mouseUp, then
	if not add the sphere (etc)
